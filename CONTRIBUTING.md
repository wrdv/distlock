## Contributing to Scalalock

Contributions are welcomed :)
Unless your intended contribution bares minor effort - it is highly recommended to post an issue/feature requests here on github first to get some feedback and perhaps trigger a discussion with other interested developers.

### Developing
Please add/update Unit Tests for new/updated functionality. Please adhere to commonly known Scala development best practices and code styling standards (I have no idea what that actually means, but it seems as right thing to write here :) )

### Building

The Project is managed by sbt. Import build.sbt with your IDE of choice and for there, the rest is (hopefully) pretty standard.

*Thanks for contributing!*
